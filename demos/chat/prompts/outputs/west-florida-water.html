<think>"What is the name of the body of water West of Florida?"                                                                                          ─╯
Okay, so I need to figure out what the body of water west of Florida is called. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's one of the Gulf states. Maybe the Gulf of Mexico? Wait, no, the Gulf of Mexico is actually off the coast of Florida, isn't it? So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe there are smaller bodies near Florida. Like, if you go west from Florida, you'd enter the Gulf of Mexico first, but then there's also another body called the Florida Bay or something similar. But I'm not certain about that either.

Let me think again. Florida is on the Atlantic coast, so going west would take you towards the Gulf of Mexico. There are bays and straits along the way, though. Oh, right! The St. John's River leads into the Gulf, but I don't think that's considered a major body of water for this question.

Wait, there's also the Bay of Pigs, isn't there? No, I think that's in Cuba. So maybe not relevant here.

Hold on, perhaps it's the Intracoastal Waterway? But no, that's more of a canal system connecting the Gulf to the Atlantic, but it doesn't have its own body of water per se.

I'm confusing myself. Let me try another approach. Florida is surrounded by the Gulf on the west and the Atlantic on the east. So maybe the primary body of water west of Florida is the Gulf of Mexico itself. But I recall hearing about a smaller body, like the Florida Bay or the Torch Lake, which are part of the Gulf.

Wait, no, the Florida Bay is actually an extension of the Gulf of Mexico and part of the Florida Straits. So maybe that's not the main answer they're looking for when asking about the body west of Florida.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Gulf of Mexico itself. I think in some contexts, people refer to the Gulf as a separate entity from the rest of the Atlantic, so maybe that's what they mean by "the water west of Florida."

But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there's another body entirely westward? Like the Caribbean Sea is east of Florida, so going further west wouldn't make sense.

Wait a minute, no, the Caribbean is to the east and southeast of Florida, so moving west from Florida would stay within the Gulf of Mexico area.

So putting it all together, I think the answer they're looking for is the Gulf of Mexico. But I'm not 100% certain because sometimes people refer to specific bays or straits as "the water" in that direction, but probably the main body is the Gulf.

The body of water west of Florida is primarily known as the Gulf of Mexico.
